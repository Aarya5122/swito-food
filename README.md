## What I Learnt

This is a landing page for a restaurant client created using HTML5 and CSS3 which helped me understand the CSS Position property, flexbox concepts, and background properties and how to handle SVG. Here I got a chance to explore the CSS Position Property. After quite a bit of hit and trail I got a clarity on the values on what to use when. I had also explored about flexbox. Overall It was a great experience.
